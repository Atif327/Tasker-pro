# How to Enable GitHub Pages

## Steps to Host Privacy Policy and Terms:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/Atif327/Tasker-pro

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Click on **Settings** tab (top right)
   - In the left sidebar, click **Pages**
   - Under **Source**:
     - Select branch: **main**
     - Select folder: **/docs**
   - Click **Save**

3. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for GitHub to build and deploy your site

4. **Your pages will be live at:**
   - Homepage: `https://atif327.github.io/Tasker-pro/`
   - Privacy Policy: `https://atif327.github.io/Tasker-pro/privacy-policy.html`
   - Terms & Conditions: `https://atif327.github.io/Tasker-pro/terms-and-conditions.html`

## ✅ What's Been Done:

- ✅ Removed all external links that caused security warnings
- ✅ Created beautiful, responsive HTML pages
- ✅ Pushed all files to your GitHub repository
- ✅ Files are in the `/docs` folder ready for GitHub Pages

## 📝 Note:

The pages are completely safe now - no external links that Chrome would flag. All content is self-contained in your repository.
